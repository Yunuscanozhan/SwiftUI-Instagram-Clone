# SwiftUI Instagram Post UI

This is my first SwiftUI project.

In this project, I built an Instagram-style post layout using:

- SwiftUI
- VStack / HStack
- ScrollView
- Image and SF Symbols
- Basic layout modifiers

## Features

- Profile header section
- Post image
- Like / comment / share icons
- Caption area
- Scrollable feed structure

## Purpose

This project was created as a practice project to understand:
- SwiftUI layout system
- Stack structures
- Basic UI composition
- Git & GitHub workflow
